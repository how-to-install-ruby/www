# How to Install Ruby

_A friendly guide._

There are many organizations that need to help people get a working ruby
environment installed on various platforms. These range from one-off
hacknights to six month developer training programs, with pretty much
everything in between.

There are also many individuals trying to get into programming, and Ruby comes
highly recommended.

Installing Ruby (or installing any software, really) is a royal pain, and it
seems like a waste of human effort and brain cycles to have all these
individuals and organizations trawl through (rapidly aging) tutorials on the
internet or maintain separate guides.

The goal of this project is to maintain a website where everyone can pitch in
and keep the installation process up-to-date.
